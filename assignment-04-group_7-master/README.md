# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Assignment 4 (Group) - APIs

---

The goal of this group assignment (which will be marked) is to compute some outcomes analogous to a paper and practice collecting and analyzing data obtained through APIs. The broad question you will try to answer is whether there is a relationship between language fractionalization and economic growth. Your analysis will build upon the work by Alesina et al (2003), a classic study in the political economy field, which developed new indices to measure ethnic, linguistic, and religious fragmentation at the country level. You will process geolocated tweets and then compute an own index of language fractionalization to see whether your results have similarities to the prior work. Then, you will interact with the World Bank API to collect country-level indicators and explore whether they are correlated with language fragmentation. The exercises conclude with exploring one further API from the WHO and combining its data with data from the World Bank API to visualize cross-country differences in economic, health, or other indicators.

You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom. Remember that we will evaluate you based on your compiled RMarkdown files (in .html format). You can add your responses in bold or italics so that it's easier for us to read them.

This is a group assignment. The assignment should name the group and its members very clearly, and one account can be used to coordinate the submission. The owner of the account can share their account with the other group members' GitHub usernames.

Note that while this is an ambitious assignment, it is broken down into clearly delineated, separate questions.  You can use the group to divide up the labour, or work on each part separately, as you wish.  GitHub should facilitate this form of distributed work.

Submissions without an html file will receive 20 points penalty.

**Deadline:** 28 November 2022, 11am (London time).
