# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 is a practise assignment and does not count towards your final grade. Its goal is to study working with data frames in R and become familar with Git/GitHub. You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub Classroom.  This will occur _automatically_ on the due date, so there is no (separate) procedure for "submitting" the assignment.  Just **make sure that you have pushed your locally changed repository to the remote on GitHub**!  You can do this as many times as you wish.

Your assignment should include all code that is used to arrive at your answers. Use and comment the code to show your work, thinking, and progress. Written responses outside of code chunks should be in bold so that it's easier to read and find them. Once you are done with your assignment, make sure to create an `.html` file. For the graded assignments later in the term, we will only grade submissions with `.html` files.


**Deadline:** Friday, 14 October 2022, 2pm (London time).

#### R Markdown guide:

  - __do not__ print out the whole dataset in your knitted document (it is fine to show how the data look like with `head()`)
  - __load all libraries in the beginning__ of your document and use `suppressMessages()` to hide all the messages this produces
  - __readability__ of your code is important --- please read through this guide to `R` code style: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
  - present only what is __necessary__, but make sure that it __answers the question__
